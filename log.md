# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 6, 2017
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Started to build an instagram like app.

**Thoughts:** I was really pumped when I thought of doing this 100 days of code challenge but also nervous for the commitment and discipline required to complete my goal. I see where I'm headed and I just have to get there and I know this is the only way I will. Choosing to start with something like "rebuilding" instagram felt comfortable. I figure it's a great way to ease me into coding consistently and eventually on my own without the help of my courses and tutorials. Stay tuned

### Day 1: June 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started to build an instagram like app.

**Thoughts:** So yesterday I said I was going to start this app and honestly i didn't start until today. I just couldn't decide and it was pretty late so, I decided to sleep on it and start fresh today. As of right now @ 11:22pm I'm at the point of adding the User account functionality via devise. I've hit a road block but I'm going to continue, I just had to get this log in for today. Below you will find a link to my git repo for this app I'm doing. My plan is to finish it before end of day Friday, June 9th. Happy coding everyone!

### Day 2: June 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to build an instagram like app.

**Thoughts:** Today, I'm honestly struggling a bit with motivation. Like I'm just over it all. But that doesn't mean I'm going to quit this challenge or this project I've already poured several hours of time over. I'm just saying. These logs won't be full of all roses and revelations all the time. I may post snippets on twitter but with the character limitations, I already know I'll have to be more detailed here in the log.md file. As usual below you'll see a link to the project I'm currently working on. Oh and I'm still hopeful to end this project by 11:59:59 pm tomorrow night. So we'll see. Happy not happy coding everyone!?! Ugh w e.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
