**Today's Progress**: Starting a new

**Thoughts:** Yeah that's right folks I'm starting a new, starting today September 24th, 2017 (it's 8pm now) I will begin my 100 days of code. I failed horribly this summer when I attempted to do this same challenge. But not this time, I will complete this challenge and I will code for 100 days straight. I have several personal projects that I'm excited to build. I've already planned out most of them with the steps I need to take to ensure they all come to fruition. That's my focus. That's my plan. I'm starting "small" and working my way up. Today I'm start with not just you average to-do app but a pro management app. Even if I get stuck I will find a way to push through and continue. I would love it if there was someone to help keep me accountable but I know that I have to fly this mission solo if I plan to make it in tech working remotely and for myself. And away.... we.... go.....

### Day 2: September 26, 2017
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Seriously!?!?

**Thoughts:** Yup, I woke up to the same problem today. I googled my little hear out and just decided to scrap everything, the project, my ruby install and all my gem. that's right I deleted it all...(pause for effect) ...Then re-installed it. Yes I did that ish. Now I'm back up & running like the wind, (I wish I could post gif in here, I posted a perfect gif on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cayferg/status/912856971451277315))... Any who I'm currently coding, but not in yesterday's projects, I feel like I need to do something else first. I'll explain more tomorrow! Good night!

### Day 3: September 27th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More info

**Thoughts:** So yesterday I was saying that I'm doing on project before I get back to the my [Daily Grind](http://www.github.com/caydn/dailygrind) project. Well I decided to get my tech blog going. I've read many places that it's something "important and looked for when potentials look at your work, and apparently I have much to say so, it's time to get it there. I'm no stranger to blogging, I use to blog about fashion and lifestyle things and I put that all the way on pause, which is another story for another day. Perhaps I'll talk about it on my new tech blog, it is a part of my journey. With all that said see the link to my current project. Oh an I'm sure I didn't say before but my language of choice os Ruby on Rails.

### Day 5: September 29th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Why am I...

**Thoughts:** Why am I stuck on this one thing. I hate getting stuck, it's just spinning and making this project seem more drawn out than it has to be. I'm still going, but damn, I'm ready to move on. F U responsive design!!!!!!!

### Day 6: September 30th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've moved on

**Thoughts:** Yup, I've moved on. I can't stay on this for too long I have other projects I'm way to excited to get to. So I refused
to be defeated or frustrated by this one thing. I'm currently still working on day 6 so stay tuned I may add more to this log...
