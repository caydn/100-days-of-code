**Today's Progress**: Starting a new

**Thoughts:** Yeah that's right folks I'm starting a new, starting today September 24th, 2017 (it's 8pm now) I will begin my 100 days of code. I failed horribly this summer when I attempted to do this same challenge. But not this time, I will complete this challenge and I will code for 100 days straight. I have several personal projects that I'm excited to build. I've already planned out most of them with the steps I need to take to ensure they all come to fruition. That's my focus. That's my plan. I'm starting "small" and working my way up. Today I'm start with not just you average to-do app but a pro management app. Even if I get stuck I will find a way to push through and continue. I would love it if there was someone to help keep me accountable but I know that I have to fly this mission solo if I plan to make it in tech working remotely and for myself. And away.... we.... go.....

**Today's Progress**: Seriously!?!?

**Thoughts:** Yup, I woke up to the same problem today. I googled my little hear out and just decided to scrap everything, the project, my ruby install and all my gem. that's right I deleted it all...(pause for effect) ...Then re-installed it. Yes I did that ish. Now I'm back up & running like the wind, (I wish I could post gif in here, I posted a perfect gif on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cayferg/status/912856971451277315))... Any who I'm currently coding, but not in yesterday's projects, I feel like I need to do something else first. I'll explain more tomorrow! Good night!
